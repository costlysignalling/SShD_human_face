## Sexual Shape Dimorphism of human face in 8 cultures

Script and data used in research paper **How and why patterns of sexual dimorphism in human faces vary across the world**

When you pull the repository and want to run the script, it is a good idea to start from the Dimorphism_Project.Rproj file.
The .Rmd file constructs the analysis report. It sources extensive chunks of code from attached R scripts directly.
If you are interested in the details of the analysis, browse the Core_script_prepare_for_report.R. It contains a commented R script that where data are loaded and further processed, most models are defined and plots are drafted.

Visualizations that are used in the paper contain a lot of additional code, which is stored in respective scripts.
You can read the knitted report in Markdown_results.pdf file.
