## Sexual Shape Dimorphism of human face in 8 cultures

Script and data used in research paper

**How and why patterns of sexual dimorphism in human faces vary across the world**

When you pull the repository and want to run the script, it is a good idea to start from the Dimorphism_Project.Rproj file.
The .Rmd file constructs the analysis report. It sources extensive chunks of code from R scripts in this repository.
If you are interested in the details of the analysis, browse the Core_script_prepare_for_report.R. It contains a commented R script that loads and further processes the data, defines most models and drafts the plots.

Visualizations that are included in the paper require a lot of additional code. It is stored in "visualization_" scripts.
You can read the knitted report in Markdown_results.pdf file.
